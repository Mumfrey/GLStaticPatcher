GLStaticPatcher
===============

**GLStaticPatcher** is a very simple tool designed for use with [Minecraft Coder Pack](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/) which restores the LWJGL OpenGL static imports to the source code.

It takes a single argument which is the base directory of the source tree to transform and can be easily integrated into MCP with some simple modifications to the python source.
